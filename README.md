Autodesk Complete Uninstaller

A single-file Windows batch tool that fully detects, uninstalls, and deep-cleans **every** Autodesk product from a machine — all versions from 2015 through 2026+. **Achieves a verified zero-remnant clean on real machines without requiring a reboot.**

Built because Autodesk's own Uninstall Tool was [discontinued after 2020](https://resources.imaginit.com/support-blog/where-is-the-autodesk-uninstall-tool-with-autodesk-2022-products), and the standard Windows "Add/Remove Programs" method leaves behind gigabytes of orphaned files, registry keys, services, and licensing artifacts that block fresh installations and waste disk space.

## Features

- **Auto-detects all installed Autodesk products** by scanning both 64-bit and 32-bit Windows registry hives
- **Classifies each product's installer type** (ODIS for 2020+, MSI for legacy, BitRock) and routes to the correct silent uninstall method automatically
- **Dependency-ordered uninstall** — removes products in the correct sequence:
  1. Add-ins, plugins, enablers, language/content packs
  2. Main applications (AutoCAD, Revit, Inventor, Maya, 3ds Max, etc.)
  3. Material Libraries (Medium Resolution → Base Resolution → Core)
  4. Desktop App, Single Sign-On
  5. Genuine Service (always last)
- **Multi-pass retry system** — rescans registry after each pass, retries failed products up to 4 times
- **ODIS orphan detection** — identifies products whose metadata XML is missing and force-cleans their registry entries
- **Deep clean** removes all traces: folders, registry keys, user file associations, COM objects, Windows services, scheduled tasks, firewall rules, shortcuts, shell extensions, FLEXnet files, CLM/LGS license data, ADUT transition data, ODIS cache, environment variables
- **Shell extension unregistration** — unregisters `AcShellExtension.dll` (DWG thumbnail handler) and restarts Explorer to release file locks
- **WMIC wildcard process kill** — terminates ANY process running from Autodesk paths, not just hardcoded names
- **Shortcut cleanup** — removes desktop shortcuts, Start Menu folders, and taskbar pins
- **Registry backup** before deletion — `.reg` export files saved to Desktop
- **System Restore Point** creation (optional) with 24-hour limit bypass
- **Comprehensive diagnostics** — generates `diagnostics.log`, `uninstall_log.txt`, and `verify_details.txt` for troubleshooting
- **16-point deep verification scan** — checks products, processes, services, folders, user data, registry hives, COM/CLSID deep scan, legacy licensing, env variables, shortcuts, tasks, firewall rules, IFEO debugger blocks, pending file renames, and hosts entries
- **Remnant search tool** — 15-point full system scan for Autodesk folders, registry file associations, COM objects, shell extensions, processes, services, pending file renames, and hosts entries
- **No reboot required** — achieves full clean in a single run on real machines
- **Single `.bat` file** — no dependencies, no installation, no PowerShell execution policy issues

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `uninstall_log.txt` | Product-level log with commands executed and exit codes |
| `diagnostics.log` | System info, ODIS state, phase timestamps, error output |
| `verify_details.txt` | Detailed list of any items found during verification |

| `reboot_cleanup.bat` | Auto-scheduled cleanup for locked folders (if needed) |

---

## Important Notes

### Before Running
- **Back up custom templates, families, and profiles** — AutoCAD CUI files, Revit families, plot styles, etc. will be permanently deleted
- **Close all Autodesk applications** before running
- **Run as Administrator** — right-click the `.bat` file and select "Run as administrator"

### FlexNet / Adobe Warning
The FlexNet Licensing Service 64 is shared between Autodesk and Adobe. If you use Adobe software, **do NOT delete this service** when prompted.

### After Running
- Run **[5] Final Verification** to confirm clean state
- Registry backups (`.reg` files) are saved to `Desktop\Autodesk_Uninstaller\`
- The tool briefly restarts Windows Explorer during cleanup (taskbar disappears for ~2 seconds) — this is normal

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Script closes immediately | Right-click → Run as administrator |
| "Access denied" errors | Ensure no Autodesk apps are running; try again |
| Products remain after uninstall | Run [4] Deep Clean to force-remove |
| ODIS uninstaller fails (exit:1) | Phase C2 automatically force-cleans these |
| Folders show as LOCKED | Tool uses takeown/icacls + Explorer restart; run Deep Clean again |
| Verification shows items in [7/16] | Run [4] Deep Clean to remove file associations |
| Error 103 during install | Run [10] Fix Error 103 for 10-point ODIS diagnosis and guided repair |
| Antivirus blocks or quarantines the script | Add an exclusion for the `.bat` file or temporarily disable real-time protection; this is a false positive |
| Windows SmartScreen blocks the file | Click **More info** > **Run anyway** — the script is unsigned but open source |

## FAQ

**Q: Will this break other software?**
A: The only shared component is FlexNet Licensing Service 64 (used by Adobe). The script always asks before touching it. Generic file type associations (EPS, WMF, Ghostscript) are intentionally left alone.

**Q: Can I remove just one product?**
A: Yes — use option [2] to pick specific products.

**Q: Does it require a reboot?**
A: No. The tool achieves a verified zero-remnant clean on real machines in a single run.

**Q: How much disk space will this free?**
A: Typically 5–50+ GB depending on installed products and the `C:\Autodesk` staging folder.

**Q: Autodesk installer gives Error 103. What do I do?**
A: Run option [10] Fix Error 103 — it performs a 10-point diagnostic covering ODIS lock files, debugger keys, service state, ODIS infrastructure, VC++ redistributables, Windows Event Viewer analysis, and hosts file checks. Each issue found can be repaired with a Y/N prompt.

**Q: My antivirus flagged the script. Is it safe?**
A: Yes. The script is a plain-text `.bat` file — you can read every line in Notepad before running it. Antivirus software sometimes flags unsigned batch scripts that modify the registry. Add an exclusion or temporarily disable real-time protection to run it.
